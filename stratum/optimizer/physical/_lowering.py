"""Logical -> physical lowering pass.

Walks the logical DAG in topological order and replaces each logical op for
which a lowering rule is registered with its physical equivalent, splicing the
new node into the graph in place (the same mutate-in-place style as the frame
extraction pass). A logical op with no registered rule is left untouched -- it
passes through and still executes via its own ``process``. This is what lets op
families migrate to the physical layer one at a time without a flag day: an
un-lowered family simply keeps running as it does today.

A rule maps ``logical op -> physical op`` and may be 1:1 or (later) 1:N. It
returns the *sink* physical node; :func:`install_lowered` copies the logical
op's edges and X/y/type metadata onto it and rewires the neighbours. The
returned node keeps the logical op's place in the DAG.
