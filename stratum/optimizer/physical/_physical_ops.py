"""Physical operator layer.

A :class:`PhysicalOp` is a node in the IR *after* lowering. Where a logical
:class:`~stratum.optimizer.ir._ops.Op` says *what* to compute in a
backend-agnostic way, a physical op says *how*: a concrete physical op
(``PandasReadCSV``, ``PolarsReadCSV``, ...) runs on exactly one backend and its
``process`` contains **no backend-selection control flow** -- the choice was
made at plan time.

Two kinds of physical op exist:

* **abstract** (``is_abstract = True``): produced by lowering; carries the
  operation's configuration but cannot run. Its concrete implementations are
  registered in the :class:`~stratum.optimizer.physical._registry.PhysicalRegistry`
  (via the ``@physical_impl`` class decorator), and the implementation-selection
  pass picks one of them per the plan context.
* **concrete** (``is_abstract = False``): the default; runnable.

Selection swaps an abstract op to its concrete impl *in place*
(``op.__class__ = impl.impl_class``) so node identity is preserved -- the buffer
pool and every ``inputs``/``outputs`` edge key on identity. Concrete impls that
share the abstract op's fields therefore need no constructor of their own. An
impl that needs extra plan-time state precomputes it in :meth:`on_impl_selected`.

The selector-facing API (:meth:`supports` / :meth:`cost` / :meth:`exec_mem`)
mirrors the fields of :class:`~stratum.optimizer.physical._registry.PhysicalImpl`;
concrete classes override them as real feasibility checks and cost/memory
estimates land.
