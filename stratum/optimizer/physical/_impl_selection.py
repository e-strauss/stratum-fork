"""Implementation-selection pass.

# TODO: Rewrite all comments
Lowering fixes the *shape* of the physical plan; this pass fixes the *impl* of
each op: which concrete backend-specific implementation actually runs. For every
op in the DAG it asks the :class:`~stratum.optimizer.physical._registry.PhysicalRegistry`
for the candidate :class:`PhysicalImpl` entries registered under the op's type,
filters them through each candidate's ``supports(op, ctx)`` check, and lets an
:class:`ImplementationSelector` choose one. The choice is then *bound* into the
op at plan time: the op is swapped to the impl's concrete
:class:`~stratum.optimizer.physical._physical_ops.PhysicalOp` class in place
(identity preserved -- the buffer pool and all DAG edges key on identity), and
its ``on_impl_selected(ctx)`` folds any plan-time state into the op. A backend
that binds by mutation (e.g. the Rust kernels, which swap a transformer's
estimator for the Rust adapter) does so in ``on_impl_selected`` on its concrete
class.

Execution afterwards is plain ``op.process`` with **no selection control flow
left**.

Ops with no candidates (un-migrated logical families, ValueOp, ChoiceOp, ...)
pass through and keep executing their own ``process``. An op that *has*
candidates but ends up with none bound is a different case: if it has no
``process`` of its own, as the frame families do not, nothing can run it, so that
fails here rather than at execution.
