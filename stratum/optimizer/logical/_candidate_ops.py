"""The operator a plan ends in when it evaluates candidates.

Choice unrolling replaces a plan's branch points with one sub-DAG per candidate, so by
the time the plan is executable there is nothing left to choose: every candidate is
computed. What terminates such a plan is a fan-in that labels each candidate's output
and, for a search, scores it.

Leaving that fan-in as a ``ChoiceOp`` cost the runtime the one thing the planner already
knew. The scheduler had to recover which operator produced which candidate by
pattern-matching the last node of the linearized plan and zipping it positionally against
the labels, and it reached the fold's labels by pinning a buffer the plan's own removal
planning could not see. Both are input edges here, so the mapping cannot drift and the
lifetime is declared.

Scoring itself is a call against those values and the fold's labels; see
``_scoring.py`` for why no estimator is involved.
