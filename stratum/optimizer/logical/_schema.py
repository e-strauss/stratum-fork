"""Schema algebra for output-schema propagation.

A *schema* is a :class:`polars.Schema` (an ordered mapping ``column name ->
dtype``). ``None`` is the *unknown* schema: the fallback for an op that cannot
determine its output, and every helper here propagates it -- any operation on an
unknown schema is unknown. A single-column op (``output_type`` ``SERIES``) still
gets a one-entry schema keyed by the column name, so column tracking is uniform
across frames and series.

**The governing invariant:** column names are exact, and a dtype is present only
when it is statically certain -- otherwise it is :data:`UNKNOWN_DTYPE`. Never
widen the set of names to stay safe: return the unknown schema instead. Names are
what the consuming rewrites (predicate pushdown, projection pushup) reason about,
so a wrong name is a correctness bug in every consumer. Hence an operation that
can null-pad a column (an outer join, a ragged union) must drop that column's
dtype: pandas widens ``int64`` to ``float64`` there.

Op families that deliberately keep the unknown default, so that the absence of a
rule reads as intent rather than an oversight:

* ``ApplyUDFOp`` -- an arbitrary user function.
* ``BaseEstimatorOp`` -- an estimator may replace every column (a
  TableVectorizer does), and the column set is only settled at fit time.
* ``ColumnSelectorOp`` -- a deferred skrub selector. Resolvable for name- and
  dtype-based selectors, but value-dependent ones (``cardinality_below``,
  ``has_nulls``, a user ``filter``) would answer from a zero-row frame without
  erroring, i.e. silently wrong. See the TODO on ``resolve_selector_columns``.
* ``MapOp`` (the base) -- each kind opts in by overriding, as ``AssignMapOp`` does.
* ``NumericOp`` -- the numpy/MATRIX world has no columns.
* ``ChoiceOp`` -- a choice combines alternative pipelines and is the last
  operation in the DAG, so no operator downstream needs its schema. Unifying the
  outcomes' schemas would be work with no consumer.

A rule covers an *operation*, not an operation family, wherever the family is not
uniformly column preserving: see ``StringMethodOp.ONE_TO_ONE_METHODS``,
``GetAttrProjectionOp.ELEMENTWISE_ACCESSORS``, ``SelectionOp._drops_rows`` and
``DatetimeConversionOp``, each of which admits only the members that map one
input column to one output column.
