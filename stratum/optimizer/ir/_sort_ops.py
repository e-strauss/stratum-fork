"""Logical row ordering (``sort_values`` / polars ``sort``).

Kept apart from :class:`~stratum.optimizer.ir._selection_ops.SelectionOp`: a
selection decides which rows survive, a sort decides what order they come out
in. Splitting them is what lets ``value_counts`` be an aggregation *plus* an
ordering rather than an aggregation with an ordering baked into its options, and
it puts the ordering somewhere a later rewrite can drop it from once we can see
that the consumer never observes row order.

    """Order rows by literal column names, or by the values of a series.

    ``by`` holds column labels rather than expressions. A computed sort key has
    no pandas spelling without materialising a column first, so an expression
    here would be a representation we could not lower; a map in front of the sort
    expresses the same thing. An empty ``by`` means "order by the values
    themselves", which is the only form a series has.

    ``ascending`` is one flag for every key or one per key, matching both
    backends. ``na_position`` is carried because the defaults disagree: pandas
    puts nulls last, polars puts them first.

    Pure config -- execution is provided by the physical impls in
    ``physical/_sort_execs.py``, selected at plan time.
