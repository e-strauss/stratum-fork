    Models both ``groupby(by).agg(...)`` and a bare reduction such as

    entries, so ``.sum()`` and ``.agg("sum")`` normalize to the same value and
    compare equal under CSE, and a computed aggregation like ``SUM(a * b)`` needs
    no separate map op. ``name`` is ``None`` when the output name comes from the
    entry's own expression (``Col("v")`` names it ``"v"``; :class:`AllCols` names
    one output per source column).

    ``grouping`` holds the grouping keys as expressions, which is what lets
    ``value_counts`` (group by the series' own values) and expression grouping
    (``groupby(df["d"].dt.year)``) share one representation.

    ``options`` carries only the groupby options that change the *result*, e.g.
    ``sort`` (which fixes the output row order) and ``dropna``. How the
    aggregation runs is the physical layer's business and has no field here.
